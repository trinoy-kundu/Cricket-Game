# Cricket Game

A small fun project where I built a simple Cricket Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The game lets the user play against the computer by choosing Bat, Ball, or Stump, and keeps track of scores using localStorage.

What I Used

|	HTML5 → to design the basic structure of the game interface
|	CSS3 → to style the buttons, layout, and text
|	JavaScript (ES6) → for all the game logic and interactivity:
|	Used functions to organize code (e.g., getResult(), showResult(), generateComputerChoice())
|	Used DOM manipulation (document.querySelector) to update the result and score dynamically
|	Used localStorage to save the score even after refreshing the page
|	Implemented event listeners for user clicks on Bat, Ball, and Stump

What I Learned

|	How to connect HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together in one project
|	How to handle user input and update elements dynamically in the browser
|	The use of localStorage for saving and restoring data
|	How to create and call functions efficiently
|	How to use if-else logic to compare choices and determine game results
|	Improved understanding of JavaScript objects and JSON parsing
|	Gained confidence in debugging and testing code step by step

💡 Reflection

This project helped me strengthen my JavaScript fundamentals and understand how logic, UI, and browser storage work together.
It was also a fun way to practice writing cleaner code and making a simple game feel interactive.
